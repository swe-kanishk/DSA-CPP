# Day 02 - Learning Journey

Today, I explored algorithms, pseudocode, and flow charts. Here's what I covered:

1. Algorithm
   - Brute Force Algorithm
   - Greedy Algorithm
2. Pseudocode
3. Flow Chart

### Algorithms:
1. **Brute Force Algorithm**  
   A straightforward approach that checks all possible solutions. It's simple but can be inefficient for large problems. Example: Linear search.

2. **Greedy Algorithm**  
   An approach that makes the best choice at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum. Itâ€™s faster but doesn't always guarantee an optimal solution. Example: Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for finding the shortest path.

### Code Representation:
3. **Pseudocode**  
   A high-level description of an algorithm using simple, human-readable language. It helps to plan the structure of the code without worrying about syntax.

4. **Flow Chart**  
   A visual representation of the flow of a process or algorithm, making it easier to understand and communicate the logic.

Iâ€™m looking forward to diving deeper into algorithms and their applications in the coming days! ðŸš€
